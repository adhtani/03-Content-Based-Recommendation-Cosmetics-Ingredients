# Content Based Recommendation - Cosmetics Ingredients   
   
**Introduction**  
The idea comes from the fact that cosmetics ingredients are made from chemicals. These chemicals work differently for each skin type or skin problems. Unlike most products such as clothes and shoes, consumer is looking for products that will work best for their skin type or problem. And most products with similar ingredients tend to provide same results. By recommending products that has similar ingredients, company is actually recommending products that will most likely work for the consumer. By doing so, they can recommend products that will increase higher customer satisfaction and as a result increase their incremental sales. In this project I will be building content-based recommendation system for cosmetics based on the ingredients of the products.
